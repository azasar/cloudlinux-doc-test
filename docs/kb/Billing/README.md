## CLN User Interface

PayPal and credit card are the payment methods available. They can be set in _Payment methods_ left sidebar menu of the _Billing_ tab.

You can create/manage activation keys only for products that have purchased licenses or an active trial. Activation key management is performed in the corresponding product’s tab (available at the top of the page). You can generate a new activation key, set server limit for it, add a note and remove a key. It is also possible to set IP range and enable Sticky tag for KernelCare keys.

Those are the default activation keys for each product.

A trial can be started only once for each product in an account. The trial period is 30 days. You can register one server for CloudLinux OS and Imunify360 trials and unlimited number of servers for KernelCare licenses. A trial can be started from _Dashboard_ tab which is the default tab in CLN UI.

- **What is a default activation key?**

A default activation key is generated automatically on server license purchase for each product.

## Troubleshooting

- **I have been billed for a higher amount of licenses than I have in my account. What is the reason for that?**

This might happen when you have added additional licenses to active subscriptions. So, as you are not charged for these licenses immediately, the charge is added as a prorated price to the next due invoice along with the renewal price of the total number of active licenses. This is the reason the amount billed is higher.

- **What is the reason for the error: You can register the IP: X.X.X.X under a paid license only.**

This can happen when you are trying to register a server using a trial license but the trial license has already been used for this IP, which is the reason why only a paid license is allowed for the registration. If you are sure you are using a trial license for the first time, please contact the Billing department for further assistance at [https://cloudlinux.zendesk.com](https://cloudlinux.zendesk.com).

- **What should I do if there’s a problem with visa/MasterCard or PayPal payment?**

If, for any reason, the payment via the selected payment method has failed, please try again several minutes later. If the problem persists, use one of the alternative methods (a credit/debit card, PayPal, or PayPal Express Checkout), or contact the Billing department for further assistance at [https://cloudlinux.zendesk.com](https://cloudlinux.zendesk.com).

There can be lots of reasons for the decline of the payment, starting from the inactive card to insufficient funds on the card balance, etc. Each case requires an investigation on the Billing side, which is the reason the Billing will help to fix the issue faster. Also, you may see an error with a general description while we can get more details from our payment provider. Possible reasons include but not limited to:

  - Expired card.
  - The card hasn't been confirmed yet.
  - PayPal agreement has been canceled.
  - Card declined by issuer — contact card issuer to determine the reason.
  - Card reported lost or stolen — contact card issuer for resolution‌.

- **What to do in case invoice has multiple products but only one was paid after clicking Pay now?**

If you have more than one outstanding invoice and only one of them has been paid while you intended to settle all unpaid invoices, you will need to contact the Billing department for further clarification at [https://cloudlinux.zendesk.com](https://cloudlinux.zendesk.com). In most cases, it means that there might be no balance on your card or PayPal account left or the payment hasn't been completed due to technical problems, which requires a further investigation on our side.

- **What to do if my account is blocked due to a debt?**

If your account has been blocked due to non-payment, you will receive a billing notification with instructions on how to settle the debt and unlock the account via email. The billing notification will also contain the alternative payment link that you can use for a quick payment. If the problem persists, please contact the Billing department at [https://cloudlinux.zendesk.com](https://cloudlinux.zendesk.com) for further assistance and investigation.

- **Is it possible to have Paypal and Credit Card payment methods set up at the same time?**

No, you have to choose one payment method to be active in a single CLN account.

- **How to add one another product in my CLN account?**

All the purchases are done the same way — adding a product to a cart and proceeding with the checkout. Each subscription type will have its own invoice generated every month/year. For example, KernelCare, CloudLinux OS, Imunify360 single-user and Imunify360 unlimited user will all have separate invoices generated every billing period.

- **Where can I update my personal and company information?**

Personal information and Password can be set in _Personal Information_ tab of _Account details_ left sidebar menu (see _Your Login → Settings_ at the top right). Company Information can be set in _Account details_ menu as well.
